    "# Text Scraping and Cleaning\n",
    "Text scraping is an incredibly common application of Natural Language Processing. **Text scraping**, sometimes called web scraping, extracts text from websites or other online sources. It involves automatically retrieving web pages, parsing the HTML content, and extracting relevant text for further analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Text scraping is a common technique used to gather large amounts of textual data from the web, which can then be used for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, language modeling, and more. By extracting text from websites, researchers and data scientists can obtain valuable data for training and testing NLP models or conducting text-based research\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, text scraping involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retrieving web pages: The scraping process starts with fetching the HTML content of web pages. This can be done using libraries or frameworks like Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, or Selenium, which provide tools for interacting with web pages programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parsing HTML content: Once the web page is retrieved, the HTML content needs to be parsed to identify the relevant text elements. HTML parsing libraries like Beautiful Soup or lxml can be used to navigate the HTML structure and extract specific text elements or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extracting text: After identifying the relevant HTML elements, the desired text is extracted from them. This may involve extracting the text from HTML tags, cleaning the text by removing unwanted characters or HTML markup, and organizing the extracted text in a suitable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing the extracted data: Finally, the extracted text can be stored in a structured format such as CSV, JSON, or a database for further analysis or integration into NLP workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that when performing text scraping, one should respect website owners' terms of service, adhere to legal and ethical guidelines, and be mindful of not overloading servers with excessive requests. Additionally, some websites may have restrictions on scraping or may require authentication for access."

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to scrape web content from the internet. Here are some common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Libraries and frameworks: Various programming libraries and frameworks provide functionality for web scraping. Some popular options include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  -  **Beautiful Soup**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, making it easier to navigate and extract data from web pages.\n",
    "  - **Scrapy**: A Python framework for building web spiders, which are specialized programs for automated web scraping.\n",
    "  -  **Selenium**: A tool for automating web browsers, useful for scraping web pages that require JavaScript execution or user interaction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. API access: Many websites and online services provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow you to access and retrieve data in a structured manner. APIs often provide specific endpoints or methods for retrieving data, which can be more reliable and efficient compared to scraping HTML directly. However, not all websites offer APIs, and some may have restrictions or require authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. RSS feeds: Some websites publish RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds that provide structured updates or summaries of their content. RSS feeds can be parsed to extract relevant text or metadata, making it easier to gather specific information from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data marketplaces: There are data marketplaces and platforms that provide pre-scraped data from various websites, saving you the effort of scraping yourself. These platforms often offer APIs or downloadable datasets for easy integration into your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Custom scripts: For websites without APIs or other scraping-friendly features, you can write custom scripts using programming languages like Python, Ruby, or JavaScript. These scripts typically simulate user interactions, such as sending HTTP requests, parsing HTML responses, and extracting desired content.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Scraping tools and services: Several tools and services are available that simplify the process of web scraping. They offer point-and-click interfaces, require little to no coding, and provide features like scheduling, data extraction, and storage. Examples include Octoparse, ParseHub, and Import.io.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by looking at two python libraries that can scrape Wikipedia for data: `wikipedia` and `beautiful soup`. In addition to these two libraries, we'll leverage `spacy` for some additional processing of the scaped text. "
